            <p>Our vision as DiamondCut Motors is to allow our customers to enjoy luxury cars, supercars, 
                and high-end cars both as car enthusiasts and as actual, willing customers. To this end, we at DiamondCut Motors try to resell
                every car at a reasonable and affordable price, relevant to today's market, to satisfy our vision that everyone should
                try a luxury car; to experience something that only appears once in a lifetime; and perhaps, acquire that experience forevermore.
                We believe that cars from prestigious brands shouldn't just be limited to the rich. Everyone should enjoy life. Nothing is impossible;
                even owning a luxury car.

            <h2>History of DiamondCut Motors</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>DiamondCut Motors was first established in 1988, starting as a small repair shop fixing motorbikes.
                Despite what seemed like a crazy idea at the time, DiamondCut Motors took a gamble, as the company purchasing our first luxury car; 
                albeit broken and in disrepair; both as a centerpiece of the then small shop as well as to promote our repair capabilities by fixing
                the luxury car. Our repair job left our customers stunned, and many potential buyers came looking for us in order to score a luxury car
                of their own. Though the money from selling this repaired luxury car didn't compare to the usual standard, this event set ourselves off
                on a journey that would transform DiamondCut Motors into what it is today: a luxury car dealership, handling both reselling and repair of
                old luxury cars, in order to share the joy of luxury cars with other car enthusiasts and car owners alike across the world. 
                Hence, DiamondCut Motors was reborn then and there. As time went on, we expanded from Indonesia to the UK, and later America, UAE, and Japan.
                As of right now, we plan on further expansions to accomodate more and more of our customers from all across the world.
